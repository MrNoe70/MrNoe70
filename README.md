- ðŸ›  Skills: C/C++, Python, Verilog, Bash, AVR/Arduino, FreeRTOS, Git

## Projects

Here are a few things I've worked on:

- **Voluntech Management System**  
  AVR Bare-metal C, ATmega328P, Keypad, I2C LCD, Relays
Developed a secure load control system using a 4x4 keypad and an I2C LCD. Controlled four appliances via password authentication on Arduino Uno using registers.

- **Temperature-Controlled Heating Systems**  
 PID Control, Embedded System
Designed and implemented a feedback-based heating system using a PID controller. Dynamically adjusted heater output to maintain target temperature.

- **Ultasonic Radar System with FreeRTOS**  
  Arduino, HC-SR04, SG90 Servo, I2C LCD, FreeRTOS
Implemented a multitasking ultrasonic radar system using FreeRTOS on Arduino Uno. Handled tasks
for motor control, distance sensing, and display.
